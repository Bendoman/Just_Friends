                <p class="lead">
                    I didn’t want to write this poem, I didn’t want to be labelled the “angry black girl", but I am
                    angry<br>
                    I’m angry because you say I’m pretty…
                    for a black girl, like that is not something magical in
                    itself<br> A club many can’t even approach<br>
                    I’m angry because I don’t see enough people who look like me on TV playing main roles, not just the
                    sassy best friend<br>
                    I’m angry that my skin has to play a factor in each decision I make<br>
                    I’m angry that the “angry black girl" is even a stereotype like we have nothing to be angry about<br>
                    Like we don’t see brothers dying every day<br>
                    I will never be ashamed of this anger I feel inside, I was born into it, shaped by it<br>
                    When will the world realize there is a person attached to this black woman?<br>
                    I do not wish to fiercely hold onto life, only dance through its seasons<br> Dance through life<br>
                    I want to write odes to the black boys who die just to get their lives on track, odes to all the
                    black girls who aren’t pretty… but beautiful<br>
                    And perhaps the world will listen <br>
                    I know I am feared, my grace, my excellence, my intelligence<br> When you put an angry black girl in
                    this world, she is a force to be reckoned with<br>
                    The next time someone tries to break me with their words, lips drawn and calls me “angry" I will
                    just laugh and thank them
                </p>

                    I will still try and write about this world even when my hands shake<br> My father, my brother, they
                    don’t float like
                    they used to before<br> They were too much body, too much bone , too much laughter, too much skin, or
                    too dangerous,
                    too much thug, or too suspicious, walking, driving, living, being<br> When will they be enough?<br> Or not
                    be too much?<br>
                    How can this “Black" blood be so cavalier yet graceful?<br>
                    I still don’t fully know what privilege is, but I believe this skin is a gift, I just wonder when
                    others will start
                    to see that<br>

                <p class="lead">
                    I woke up on a Wednesday morning to the world running still, the rain was shy as it fell from my
                    window<br> My mirror was
                    exact yet broken<br> The dust that rose from my wry windowsill swallowed me whole, drowned me in the
                    sound of missed
                    laughter<br> I tried to rearrange the small things that laid in my room, those inanimate joy givers<br>
                    Yet my bleak curtains that day would not move<br> The sun would not enter and maintain my morality<br> I
                    walked onto the
                    broken step, and it cried louder that day reminding me of my weight<br>
                    Each room, silent filled with cobwebs and stories of past lives<br> The room beside mine was cold for
                    it belonged to a man
                    who once was<br> I went to my parents room to try and find my own hero’s and isolate them too with a
                    scope of my own
                    individualism, but when I go outside and look above this empty little house I see the sky, with pale
                    clouds offended
                    that there are no crowds left to come and see<br> Yet that’s where my father and my brother explore<br>
                    Where they can be men,
                    or maybe <em>say</em> they are being men, I don’t quite remember<br> But then, I must return to my own room 6
                    meters away from this
                    unknown force where still, the curtain has not moved, but my bed has been made

                    When will my poetry be enough but not be too much<br>
                    When can I write to make a point but not take that point too far?<br>
                    If my poem is published, is it still mine?<br> But if I write a poem and nobody hears it, did I even
                    write it?<br>
                    So when can I just spill my body onto the page?<br> Let the words trickle from my mouth like honey<br>
                    When can I stop writing my poetry for the award, the show, the expectation and start writing for me?<br>
                    Perhaps there will be a time where I can write a poem as long as I want<br> A manifesto of the human
                    spirit of a eulogy to
                    the person I once was<br> I want to look at my poem and not become an instant critic for your eyes<br> I
                    want to look at my
                    poem and never have to count the lines<br> So maybe my poems are too long, or too short, or too
                    boring…<br>
                    Does that mean that they aren’t art anymore?<br> Are they not good?<br> Are they even poerty?

                <p class="lead">
                    Teach me how to sink like you, I said to the historic wreck<br> The Weeping Lady capsized and sank in
                    2001, washed away
                    without a trace<br>
                    Teach me how to disappear, to make people feel something, to make people love the idea of wretched
                    wood and disassembled
                    doors and Baltic ballrooms and scattered sails<br>
                    The disgraced boat let out an anguished sigh<br> “why must you sink? Are you not human?" she asked me<br>
                    “Don’t you have this
                    ability to stay afloat? With those powerful lungs and kicking legs, are you not aware of the
                    buoyancy of your own
                    heart?"<br>
                    I have decided to sink<br> I told her that I am tired of this shore, getting caught up in this tangle
                    of people’s lives so
                    I must leave and sink<br> The boat laughed “Is this the only shore you have seen?<br> Is this the only sea
                    you have swam in?<br>
                    You, human, do not see how lucky you are, how much freedom you have<br> I was brought up a poor boat<br> I
                    wept each night and
                    disguised it as waves<br> I was engulfed by my only love, swallowed by the icy cold water of the ocean I
                    once rejoiced in<br> I
                    have lived here for 19 years collecting skeletons and singing siren songs<br> How dare you come to my
                    floor and ask me to
                    teach you how to sink?<br> How to do something I haven’t even taught myself"<br>
                    The boat uttered “you are human, you are not a boat, you are not sinkable, you contain multitudes,
                    you are a poet, so
                    write, write sonnets and odes and eulogies, write until the ink in your pen has run its course<br>
                    Write about worlds where
                    you are happy, where shame is banned, where love is the air, and you are free to breathe deep<br> Write
                    everything, and then write more, just write and live, live by the sun and don’t listen to my moody push and pull<br> Do not
                    sink, do not sink, do
                    not sink"

                <p class="lead">
                    I still don’t know what it means to be a teenage girl<br> All I hear is contradictions<br> What is a
                    teenage girl supposed
                    to look like?<br> Are my knees supposed to shake with insecurity<br> Do I swoon over celebrities, whisper
                    with my friends
                    about the people we pass by?<br> Why is it men who laugh when I do these things?<br> Call me girly<br> So, I
                    stand up straight
                    with confidence<br> Spend my time writing, spilling my thoughts onto paper, I keep a straight face with
                    my friends<br> But
                    those same men who still laugh, call me bossy<br> So, what is a teenage girl supposed to look like?<br> And
                    why is it men
                    that get to decide the answer?<br>
                    The science of teenage girls will remain a mystery<br> Today I will question everything about myself
                    but tomorrow I
                    will continue to grow<br> Perhaps I am just that, a contradiction

                    That summer smelled like peaches and honey<br> I remember we cycled through the rundown streets<br> You
                    had your arms out
                    and danced in the pale air<br> There was something immersive about your skin, like it was painted by
                    camera flashes at
                    each moment<br> You spoke to me in broken English, and it felt just like a song<br> When you sang to me
                    each night on that
                    balcony, I called it love or maybe I called it life, I can’t remember<br> In one moment, you said you
                    loved me, and the
                    sun kissed my skin, and I could smell those peaches and I could taste the honey almost like it
                    tricked from my
                    mouth<br> And in another we jumped into the cold sea, hand in hand<br> Never coming back up for air

                    Once in a while, I like to leave my small town and sit on the outskirts of the city<br> I watch cars
                    drive down the
                    motorway under the dim of broken streetlights and in that moment, I am filled with a glance of
                    solitude and bliss<br>
                    In that moment, the stars try and understand the enigma that is me<br> They compare me to the moon<br> They
                    say I
                    understand what I feels like to be untouchable, an unbounded conundrum no celestial body could
                    grasp<br> The stars,
                    they thank me for giving them a chance to shine brighter when I am not feeling whole<br> You are a kind
                    body, they say<br>
                    For even when you are deflated, you let us show off our glow<br> You give us the opportunity to hear
                    wishes and sirens
                    from those who are smart enough to believe we are listening<br> You let us fall until we find where we
                    truly belong in
                    this beautifully chaotic mess, we call a galaxy<br> Is that not what unlimited possibility is about?<br>
                    They ask me, where
                    to next?<br> And I can only think of the path that is discovered<br> When my jagged pen hits the paper<br> It
                    is on that path,
                    I can truly find my way home

                    “You’re so black" and just like that the skin I once cherished becomes my biggest disgrace<br> Oh,
                    repugnant thing! Why
                    must you cover me like this, swallow me whole, leave no room, for light, for pure, for goodness, for
                    holy innocence<br> Why
                    can’t you make me decent, my must you be a constant memory of hardship, of difficulty<br> Why must you

                    Subject to even more criticism<br> But perhaps this is most true, this skin so black, acts a shield,

                    these lips for a

                    be so mild and
                    mellow and beautiful<br> Such golden sweetness, the heavy sun laying itself to rest on our skin<br> I know
                    your God sits in
                    disposition, this blessing, this “black" magic he graced upon us to wear as skin being called into

                    The day we stopped talking I had to learn to breathe on my own<br> When you kissed me, you introduced

                    You made me feel whole, I swear I was swimming in your grace<br> But you left and it felt like I was

                    themselves<br> I had to remind
                    myself o the buoyancy of the human heart<br> I try and try to find the silver lining of our tethering<br>
                    It’s hard to
                    remember sometimes<br> But you gave me the confidence to love knowing I would it make it to shore

                    The bags under my eyes
                    start to feel ashamed<br> They try to hide themselves under cucumber face masks<br> But every so often I
                    tell my bags to show
                    themselves and rejoice in what they are<br> They are suitcases for the stories my mouth cannot tell<br>
                    They are stars that
                    work so closely with the moon and the clouds and the streetlights to help me broil up a concoction
                    of words that breathe
                    life into ends so deeply asleep<br> They are proof that the best poetry is written at night<br> That some
                    people fear the
                    stillness and sorrow that 3 A.M draws out<br> That the glow of a kitchen oven and the ticking of a
                    clock can be deafening<br>
                    So, if you talk to me and I seem “far away" it is because I am<br> I am merely imagining a place no
                    dream can bring me<br> A
                    place where that ticking clock is a radio blaring the most freeing music<br> Where love is the air, and
                    I am breathing so
                    recklessly<br> A place where that oven glow is the sun, luminous and bright<br> It’s long days like arms,
                    swaying with me in
                    the streets<br> You see in this place the sun dances with me in ways the moon dares to understand<br> So
                    yeah, maybe I do look
                    “tired", but I have a damn good reason to
                </p>

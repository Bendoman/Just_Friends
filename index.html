                <p class="lead">
                    I didn’t want to write this poem, I didn’t want to be labelled the “angry black girl”, but I am
                    angry.
                    I’m angry because you say I’m pretty….. for a black girl, like that is not something magical in
                    itself. A club many can’t even approach.
                    I’m angry because I don’t see enough people who look like me on TV playing ain roles, not just the
                    sassy best friend.
                    I’m angry that my skin has to play a factor in each decision I make.
                    I’m angry that the “angry black girl” is even a stereotype like we have nothing to be angry about.
                    Like we don’t see brothers dying every day.
                    I will never be ashamed of this anger I feel inside, I was born into it , moulded by it.
                    When will the world realize there is a person attached to this black woman?
                    I do not wish to fiercely hold onto life, only dance through its seasons. Dance through life.
                    I want to write odes to the black boys who die just to get their lives on track, odes to all the
                    black girls who aren’t pretty… but beautiful.
                    And perhaps the world will listen .
                    I know I am feared, my grace, my excellence, my intelligence. When you put an angry black girl in
                    this world, she is a force to be reckoned with.
                    The next time someone tries to break me with their words, lips drawn and calls me “angry” I will
                    just laugh and thank them.

                    I will still try and write about this world even when my hands shake. My father, my brother, they
                    don’t float like
                    they used to before. They were too much body, too much bone , too much laughter, too much skin, or
                    too dangerous,
                    too much thug, or too suspicious, walking, driving, living, Being. When will they be enough? Or not
                    be too much?
                    How can this “Black” blood be so cavalier yet graceful?
                    I still don’t fully know what privilege is, but I believe this skin is a gift, I just wonder when
                    others will start
                    to see that.

                <h1 class="contents-header" id="brother-and-father">My Brother and Father left on Wednesday Morning</h1>

                <p class="lead">
                    I woke up on a Wednesday morning to the world running still, the rain was shy as it fell from my
                    window. My mirror was
                    exact yet broken. The dust that rose from my wry window still swallowed me whole, drowned me in the
                    sound of missed
                    laughter. I tried to rearrange the small things that laid in my room, those inanimate joy givers.
                    Yet my bleak curtains that day would not move. The sun would not enter and maintain my morality. I
                    walked onto the
                    broken step, and it cried louder that day reminding me of my weight.
                    Each room, silent filled with cobwebs and stories of past lives. The room beside mine was cold for
                    it belonged to a man
                    who once was. I went to my parents room to try and find my own hero’s and isolate them too with a
                    scope of my own
                    individualism, but when I go outside and look above this empty little house I see the sky, with pale
                    clouds offended
                    that there are no crowds left to come and see. Yet that’s where my father and my brother explore.
                    Where they can be men,
                    or maybe “say” they are being men, I don’t quite remember. But then I must return to my own room 6
                    meters away from this
                    unknown force where still, the curtain has not moved, but my bed has been made.

                <p class="lead">
                    When will my poetry be enough but not be too much
                    When can I write to make a point but not take that point too far?
                    If my poem is published, is it still mine? But if I write a poem and nobody hears it, did I even
                    write it?
                    So when can I just spill my body onto the page? Let the words trickle from my mouth like honey.
                    When can I stop writing my poetry for the award, the show, the expectation and start writing for me?
                    Perhaps there will be a time where I can write a poem as long as I want. A manifesto of the human
                    spirit of a eulogy to
                    the person I once was. I want to look at my poem and not become an instant critic for your eyes. I
                    want to look at my
                    poem and never have to count the lines. So maybe my poems are too long, or too short, or too
                    boring….
                    Does that mean that they aren’t art anymore? Are they not good? Are they even poerty?

                <h1 class="contents-header" id="poor-boat">A conversation with a poor boat</h1>

                <p class="lead">
                    Teach me how to sink like you, I said to the historic wreck. The Weeping Lady capsized and sank in
                    2001, washed away
                    without a trace.
                    Teach me how to disappear, to make people feel something, to make people love the idea of wretched
                    wood and disassembled
                    doors and Baltic ballrooms and scattered sails.
                    The disgraced boat let out an anguished sigh “why must you sink? Are you not human?” she asked me.
                    “Don’t you have this
                    ability to stay afloat? With those powerful lungs and kicking legs, are you not aware of the
                    buoyancy of your own
                    heart?”
                    I have decided to sink. I told her that I am tired of this shore, getting caught up in this tangle
                    of people’s lives so
                    I must leave and sink. The boat laughed “Is this the only shore you have seen? Is this the only sea
                    you have swam in?
                    You, human, do not see how lucky you are, how much freedom you have. I was brought up a poor boat. I
                    wept each night and
                    disguised it as waves. I was engulfed by my only love swallowed by the icy cold water of the ocean I
                    once rejoiced in. I
                    have lived here for 19 years collecting skeletons and singing siren songs. How dare you come to my
                    floor and ask me to
                    teach you how to sink? How to do something I haven’t even taught myself”.
                    The boat uttered “you are human, you are not a boat, you are not sinkable, you contain multitudes,
                    you are a poet, so
                    write, write sonnets and odes and eulogies, write until the ink in your pen has run its course.
                    Write about worlds where
                    you are happy where shame is banned where love is the air, and you are free to breathe deep. Write
                    everything, write
                    nothing, just write and live, live by the sun and don’t listen to my moody push and pull. Do not
                    sink, do not sink, do
                    not sink”.
                    That is what I heard that night, the night I went and asked a boat to teach me how to sink, so here
                    I am, writing an ode
                    to that poor boat.

                    looks up to them
                    and asks for advice. The peaches dripped in honey hang from lame trees asking me to pick them. The

                    write. But alas July
                    loses itself and turns into chilly August which trickles into September. Those beautiful July leaves
                    get too
                    vulnerable and begin to fall. The moon starts to feel more confident. The girls have cut their hair
                    and the boys
                    stay at home. Now each September night feels like Sunday stuck on repeat.

                <p class="lead">
                    I still don’t know what it means to be a teenage girl. All I hear is contradictions. What is a
                    teenage girl supposed
                    to look like? Are my knees supposed to shake with insecurity. Do I swoon over celebrities, whisper
                    with my friends
                    about the people we pass by? Why is it men who laugh when I do these things? Call me girly. So, I
                    stand up straight
                    with confidence. Spend my time writing, spilling my thoughts onto paper, I keep a straight face with
                    my friends. But
                    those same men who still laugh, call me bossy. So, what is a teenage girl supposed to look like? And
                    why is it men
                    that get to decide the answer?
                    The science of teenage girls will remain a mystery. Today I will question everything about myself
                    but tomorrow I
                    will continue to grow. Perhaps I am just that, a contradiction.

                    That summer smelled like peaches and honey. I remember we cycled through the rundown streets. You
                    had your arms out
                    and danced in the pale air. There was something immersive about your skin, like it was painted by
                    camera flashes at
                    each moment. You spoke to me in broken English, and it felt just like a song. When you sang to me
                    each night on that
                    balcony, I called it love or maybe I called it life, I can’t remember. In one moment, you said you
                    loved me, and the
                    sun kissed my skin, and I could smell those peaches and I could taste the honey almost like it
                    tricked from my
                    mouth. And in another we jumped into the cold sea, hand in hand. Never coming back up for air.

                <p class="lead">
                    Once in a while, I like to leave my small town and sit on the outskirts of the city. I watch cars
                    drive down the
                    motorway under the dim of broken streetlights and in that moment, I am filled with a glance of
                    solitude and bliss.
                    In that moment the stars try and understand the enigma that is me. They compare me to the moon. They
                    say I
                    understand what I feels like to be untouchable, an unbounded conundrum no celestial body could
                    grasp. The stars,
                    they thank me for giving them a chance to shine brighter when I am not feeling whole. You are a kind
                    body, they say.
                    For even when you are deflated, you let us show off our glow. You give us the opportunity to hear
                    wishes and sirens
                    from those who are smart enough to believe we are listening. You let us fall until we find where we
                    truly belong in
                    this beautifully chaotic mess, we call a galaxy. Is that not what unlimited possibility is about?
                    They ask me, where
                    to next? And I can only think of the path that is discovered. When my jagged pen hits the paper. It
                    is on that path,
                    I can truly find my way home.

                    The world is full of contradictions. A movie meant to frighten taught me about love. How loneliness
                    makes us do crazy
                    things. I remember hearing the shrill screams on the big screen. It reminded me of lust. Oh, to be
                    that high, to have my
                    heartbeat that fast, to feel adrenaline, feel something. In defence of scary movies, they never told
                    us this isn’t how
                    we should love. No matter what, he always gets the girl, they always end up entangled. Is that not
                    what love is? A
                    series of moments, just like a movie.

                    “You’re so black” and just like that the skin I once cherished becomes my biggest disgrace. Oh,
                    repugnant thing! Why
                    must you cover me like this, swallow me whole, leave no room, for light, for pure, for goodness, for
                    holy innocence. Why
                    can’t you make me decent, my must you be a constant memory of hardship, of difficulty. Why must you
                    make me different?
                    Subject to even more criticism. But perhaps this is most true, this skin so black, acts a shield,
                    protection from the
                    hurt you throw at me. “Big lips” a reminder that I did not choose to be a poet but rather was given
                    these lips for a
                    reason. You must ever wonder why such tender beauty prefers the darkness. How can such “black” blood
                    be so mild and
                    mellow and beautiful. Such golden sweetness, the heavy sun laying itself to rest on our skin. I know
                    your God sits in
                    disposition, this blessing, this “black” magic he graced upon us to wear as skin being called into
                    question. Look how
                    they failed you, with their fluttering thumbs and ignorance, failed your marvellous “black”
                    creations.

                    The day we stopped talking I had to learn to breathe on my own. When you kissed me, you introduced
                    air into my lungs.
                    You made me feel whole, I swear I was swimming in your grace. But you left and it felt like I was
                    sinking. I couldn’t
                    stop free falling. I was in an ice-cold ocean, alone. I had to teach my lungs how to work by
                    themselves. I had to remind
                    myself o the buoyancy of the human heart. I try and try to find the silver lining of our tethering.
                    It’s hard to
                    remember sometimes. But you gave me the confidence to love knowing I would it make it to shore
                    somehow

                    You ask me “Have I slept in the last few days?” say I look very “tired”. I shrug and stay silent.
                    The bags under my eyes
                    start to feel ashamed. They try to hide themselves under cucumber face masks. But every so often I
                    tell my bags to show
                    themselves and rejoice in what they are. They are suitcases for the stories my mouth cannot tell.
                    They are stars that
                    work so closely with the moon and the clouds and the streetlights to help me broil up a concoction
                    of words that breathe
                    life into ends so deeply asleep. They are proof that the best poetry is written at night. That some
                    people fear the
                    stillness and sorrow that 3 A.M draws out. That the glow of a kitchen oven and the ticking of a
                    clock can be deafening.
                    So, if you talk to me and I seem “far away” it is because I am. I am merely imagining a place no
                    dream can bring me. A
                    place where that ticking clock is a radio blaring the most freeing music. Where love is the air, and
                    I am breathing so
                    recklessly. A place where that oven glow is the sun, luminous and bright. It’s long days like arms,
                    swaying with me in
                    the streets. You see in this place the sun dances with me in ways the moon dares to understand. So
                    yeah, maybe I do look
                    “tired”, but I have a damn good reason to.

                    deafening. I do not want to furiously exist, only sway through the motions. When the isolation
                    speaks. I listen
                    fiercely. I still can not answer. I can not find my direction. I will look for a path where I can
                    slowly trip my way
                    back to myself. Rather naively, I wonder some nights, can isolation tell me where to go?

                    warmth for a blue planet that is cold with its affection. She graces the sky with these grey clouds,
